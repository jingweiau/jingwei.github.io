      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Jingwei Zhang is a final year PhD candidate in Physical Oceanography working at the University of Tasmania (UTAS) and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Hobart, Tasmania. His work uses numerical models (ocean and sea ice), observations, and theory to understand the interactions between Antarctica, sea ice, and ocean and their roles in our changing climate. 
• Physical Oceanography • Southern Ocean dynamics • Sea ice-Ocean modelling • Antarctic meltwater • Climate variability • Climate model coupling • Polar and climate science • Tidal modelling
